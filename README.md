# Data Sonification Projects

Welcome to my collection of data sonification projects. Here, I transform intricate environmental datasets into immersive auditory experiences. Dive into each project to explore the unique story each dataset tells when translated into sound.

## Overview

- **Data Acquisition**: Harnessing datasets from renowned sources like GEE, NOAA, and more.
- **Data Analysis**: In-depth analysis of each dataset to extract meaningful patterns and insights.
- **Sonification**: Converting data patterns into sound, providing an alternative way to understand and interpret the data.
- **Visuals**: Accompanying each sonification with visual representations for a comprehensive understanding.

## Projects

Each folder in this repository represents a unique project. Navigate to individual folders to explore the datasets, code, sonifications, and visuals specific to that project.
