# 🌍 Desertification Drones: Monitoring Desertification in the Sahel Region 🥁

## 🌐 Study Region

The Sahel region, a transitional zone in Africa between the Sahara to the north and the Sudanian Savanna to the south. Covering parts of Senegal, Mauritania, Mali, Burkina Faso, Algeria, Niger, Nigeria, Chad, Sudan, and Eritrea.

## 🛰️ Data Source

We utilize MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite imagery to monitor vegetation changes indicative of desertification.

## 📈 Steps to Reproduce

1. **Data Acquisition**: Retrieve MODIS NDVI data for the Sahel region.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Process and normalize the satellite data to highlight areas of vegetation loss.
3. **Data Visualization**: Visualize the processed data using Python libraries and tools like `folium`, `rasterio`, and `matplotlib` and create a timelapse video of the change in NDVI 
     values over time
   
   **Timelapse video**

## 📦 Packages Used

- `folium`: For interactive map visualizations.
- `rasterio`: To handle raster data.
- `matplotlib`: For colormaps and other visualization utilities.
- `selenium`: For saving folium maps as images.

## 🎵 Sonification

This project aims to transform the desertification data into sound, allowing for an auditory experience of environmental changes. The sonification and blended music composition process is currently in the works. Stay tuned for updates!
