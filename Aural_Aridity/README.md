# Aural Aridity 🎶🏜️

Welcome to "Aural Aridity", where the intricacies of drought conditions are sonified into evocative musical notes, painting a sonic picture of arid landscapes.

## Overview 🌐

"Aural Aridity" is a project that sonifies the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). This sonification, combined with a musical composition, offers listeners a unique perspective on drought conditions over time.

## Data Source and Information 📜

The SPEI data for this project is sourced from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). SPEI is an index that quantifies drought by considering both precipitation and potential evapotranspiration. It provides a comprehensive measure of water availability and drought severity.

### Study Area 🌎

The study focuses on the contiguous United States, providing insights into the drought conditions prevalent in this vast region.

## Data Processing and Visualization 📊

1. **Data Acquisition and Cleaning**:
   - **R Packages Used**: [Specify the R packages used for data acquisition and cleaning]
   - Using R, we've acquired the SPEI data from the netCDF file format.
   - Data Cleaning: The raw data was subset to focus on the relevant time frame, ensuring that we captured the essence of drought conditions over the years.

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Yearly Averages: The dataset provides monthly SPEI values. To provide a clearer trend, we calculated the yearly average SPEI for each year.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Plots: We've created plots for each year to visualize the average SPEI. These plots offer a visual representation of the drought trends over the years.

## Blended Music Composition 🎼

The sonified data provides an auditory representation of drought conditions. This sonification will be harmoniously blended with a musical composition, creating a symphonic experience that resonates with the rhythm of aridity.
